This test check transports out of parameter domain that Gill's model stays valid.

For simplicity, we use the damping scheme: = h*u

cbxy = 0.1, yd =45, ld = 1.0, t = 400

h = 0.2:
run001 - wc = 0.6, dt = 0.01, nx = 600, ny = 1200
run002 - wc = 1.6, dt = 0.01, nx = 600, ny = 600
run003 - wc = 2.8, dt = 0.01, nx = 600, ny = 600
run004 - wc = 4.0, dt = 0.01, nx = 600, ny = 600 

h = 0.6:
run005 - wc = 2.8, dt = 0.01, nx = 600, ny = 600
run006 - wc = 4.0, dt = 0.01, nx = 600, ny = 600

h = 1.0:
run007 - wc = 0.6, dt = 0.01, nx = 600, ny = 1200
run008 - wc = 1.6, dt = 0.01, nx = 600, ny = 600
run009 - wc = 2.8, dt = 0.01, nx = 600, ny = 600
run010 - wc = 4.0, dt = 0.01, nx = 600, ny = 600

h = 1.4:
run011 - wc = 0.6, dt = 0.01, nx = 600, ny = 1200
run012 - wc = 1.6, dt = 0.01, nx = 600, ny = 600
run013 - wc = 2.8, dt = 0.01, nx = 600, ny = 600
run014 - wc = 4.0, dt = 0.01, nx = 600, ny = 600

h = 0.8:
run015 - wc = 0.6, dt = 0.01, nx = 600, ny = 1200
run016 - wc = 1.6, dt = 0.01, nx = 600, ny = 600
run017 - wc = 2.8, dt = 0.01, nx = 600, ny = 600
