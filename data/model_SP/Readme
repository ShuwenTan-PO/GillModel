SP experiments

For simplicity, we use the damping scheme: = h*u

yd =45, ld = 1.0, t = 800

Friction experiment
cbxy = 0.2
run001 - wc = 1.6, h = 0.6, dt = 0.01, nx = 600, ny = 600
run002 - wc = 0.6, h = 0.6, dt = 0.01, nx = 600, ny = 1200
run003 - wc = 1.6, h = 0.4, dt = 0.01, nx = 600, ny = 600

No Friction experiment
cbxy = 0
run011 - wc = 1.6, h = 0.6, dt = 0.01, nx = 600, ny = 600
run012 - wc = 0.6, h = 0.6, dt = 0.01, nx = 600, ny = 1200
